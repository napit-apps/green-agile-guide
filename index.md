# Agile Meets Sustainability

## A structured guide for integrating sustainability into agile product development

The Green Agile Guide defines how agile teams can deliver valuable software while reducing ecological, economic, and social harm.  
It extends established agile roles, artifacts, and practices with measurable sustainability principles and KPIs — without introducing new meetings or frameworks.

## Why this guide?

Agile methods have improved how software is delivered.  
But they rarely address the long-term ecological, economic, or social impact of the systems we build.

This guide introduces a structured approach to integrate sustainability into agile product development — without adding organizational overhead.

It is based on three dimensions:

- **Ecological** – Reduce energy consumption, emissions, and waste in software systems  
- **Economic** – Support long-term maintainability and responsible use of resources  
- **Social** – Protect team health, promote inclusion, and ensure ethical development

{: .note }
This is not a new framework. It is a focused extension of agile practices and roles, with sustainability as a core concern.

## Current status

It evolves through practical work with agile teams and reflects real-world challenges in aligning product development with sustainability goals.

A [preview version](/guide) is already available and includes selected chapters, definitions, and metrics.
