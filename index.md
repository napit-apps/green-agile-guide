# Green Agile  
**A structured extension of agile practices — with sustainability as a core concern**

Agile methods have improved delivery speed. But their ecological, economic, and social impact often remains unclear.

This guide helps teams build software that **lasts longer**, **consumes fewer resources**, and **supports team well-being** — without adding new frameworks or process overhead.

It extends agile roles and artifacts with practical, sustainability-driven guidance.

## Why this guide?

Agile methods have improved how software is delivered.  
But they rarely address the long-term ecological, economic, or social impact of the systems we build.

This guide introduces a structured approach to integrate sustainability into agile product development — without adding organizational overhead.

It builds on the three established dimensions of sustainability:

- **Ecological** – Reduce energy consumption, emissions, and waste in software systems  
- **Economic** – Support long-term maintainability and responsible use of resources  
- **Social** – Protect team health, promote inclusion, and ensure ethical development

{: .note }
This is not a new framework. It is a focused extension of agile practices and roles, with sustainability as a core concern.

## Current status

The Green Agile Guide is an independent initiative started by **Marcel Russ**, an experienced Agile Coach, sustainability advocate, and founder of [mehr.wert Software und IT Beratung GmbH](https://mehrwert.tech).  
It builds on real-world experience from software delivery, scaled agile environments, and sustainability practices in enterprise IT.

The Green Agile Guide evolves through practical work with agile teams and reflects real-world challenges in aligning product development with sustainability goals.

A [first version](/guide) is already available and includes selected chapters, definitions, and metrics.
