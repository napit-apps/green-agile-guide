## EU Dispute Resolution

The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR):

You can find our email address above.

## Consumer Dispute Resolution

We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.

## Liability for Content

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7(1) TMG and general legislation.  
According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.  
However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

## Liability for Links

Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents.  
The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.  
The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was recognizable at that time.

A permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
