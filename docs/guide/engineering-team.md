# Engineering Team

**Turning sustainability into technical excellence**

The Engineering Team plays a central role in delivering solutions that are **sustainable by design** — across code, infrastructure, architecture, and day-to-day practices.

Rather than adding complexity, Green Agile expands the team's responsibility by making sustainability a **visible and conscious dimension** of technical work. This includes decisions on what to build, how to build it, and how to ensure long-term quality and impact.

Typical roles include:

- Software Developers and Engineers  
- Architects and Technical Leads  
- DevOps and Infrastructure Engineers  
- QA and Test Automation Experts  
- Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)  
- Platform and Data Engineers

The Green Agile Engineering Team is not a new structure — it is a refined lens for teams already working in agile environments.

## Core focus areas

### Sustainable implementation decisions

- **Write energy-efficient and lean code**  
  Favor performant, resource-saving solutions that avoid unnecessary processing or network usage

- **Use libraries and tools with long-term support**  
  Avoid fragile dependencies and over-engineered frameworks with short life cycles

- **Minimize build and deploy overhead**  
  Optimize CI/CD pipelines and container setups to reduce wasted compute cycles and cloud costs

---

### Architecture and system design

- **Design for maintainability and modularity**  
  Enable easier refactoring, reduce technical debt, and support team scalability

- **Make sustainability a design criterion**  
  Consider energy usage, data consumption, and lifecycle cost alongside performance and availability

- **Prefer scalable and adaptive infrastructure**  
  Use cloud resources responsibly, reduce idle capacity, and support green deployment strategies (e.g., low-traffic shutdowns)

---

### Engineering culture and team behavior

- **Foster collective ownership of sustainability**  
  Encourage shared awareness and open discussion of environmental and social trade-offs in code reviews and planning sessions

- **Balance delivery speed with long-term quality**  
  Push back against unsustainable deadlines, and advocate for technical practices that support healthy team dynamics

- **Document decisions for future clarity**  
  Ensure transparency and handover readiness, reducing risks of waste and rework over time

---

## Responsibilities across all dimensions

### Ecological sustainability

- Reduce energy consumption in both frontend and backend systems  
- Avoid unnecessary data collection, storage, and transmission  
- Optimize resource usage in build, deploy, and runtime environments  
- Use infrastructure that supports green energy or low-carbon operations

### Economic sustainability

- Build solutions with minimal technical debt and clear architectural decisions  
- Optimize for long-term maintainability and extensibility  
- Avoid short-lived trends and tools that increase future migration costs  
- Prevent infrastructure overprovisioning and reduce cloud cost spikes

### Social sustainability

- Respect accessibility and inclusive design in technical implementations  
- Support sustainable team pacing with clean, understandable code  
- Build systems that promote digital wellbeing and reduce cognitive overload for users

## Measuring impact

The Engineering Team supports sustainability by making technical outcomes observable and traceable.  
While not all impact is easily quantified, key metrics can guide improvement over time.

Examples by dimension:

- **Ecological**  
  - Energy consumption per request or user session  
  - CI/CD energy footprint (build minutes, compute usage)  
  - Backend optimization ratio (e.g. cache hits, db queries avoided)

- **Economic**  
  - Technical debt trend (e.g. code complexity, TODOs, duplicated logic)  
  - Time to onboard a new developer  
  - Mean time to refactor / modularize existing code

- **Social**  
  - Codebase accessibility (e.g. documentation quality, test coverage)  
  - Team code review balance (participation, constructive feedback)  
  - Developer satisfaction metrics (e.g. surveys, retention signals)

## Final note

The Engineering Team makes sustainability real — not through slogans, but through **thousands of daily decisions** that shape the technical foundation of modern software.

By anchoring ecological, economic, and social impact in the team's mindset and methods, Green Agile empowers engineers to build systems that matter — and that last.
