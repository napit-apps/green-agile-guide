# Responsibility

Responsibility means taking ownership of the impact we create — intentionally, across roles and decisions.

In agile product development, this includes:

- Making trade-offs visible and explainable  
- Choosing sustainable defaults where possible  
- Addressing consequences beyond the current sprint

Responsibility is not about perfection or guilt.  
It’s about **acknowledging impact** and **making conscious choices** that reflect both short- and long-term value.

Where awareness creates visibility, responsibility creates movement.

{: .note }
Responsibility is not a role — it is a shared value.  
It grows when teams have the space, tools, and support to act on what they learn.
