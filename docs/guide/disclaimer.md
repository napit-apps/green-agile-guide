# Disclaimer & Scope

## Positioning and compatibility

The Green Agile Guide is not a replacement for frameworks like Scrum, SAFe, or others.  
It is intended as a focused extension for teams and organizations that want to integrate sustainability into their agile practice.

Its structure builds on familiar concepts — roles, artifacts, commitments — and introduces sustainability-related additions where relevant.  
These additions do not aim to redefine existing agile methods but to sharpen their application with regard to sustainability.

---

## Legal independence

The Green Agile Guide is an independent publication.  
It is not affiliated with Scrum.org, the authors of the Scrum Guide, or any other official body.

All terms and concepts have been developed independently.  
Where similarities exist, they are based on widespread agile practice, not on licensed or proprietary material.

---

## Naming and terminology

To reflect its focus and ensure clarity, the guide introduces several naming changes.  
For example, *Sprint* becomes *Development Iteration*, and *Scrum Master* becomes *Green Agile Coach*.  
These changes serve two purposes:

- To emphasize the sustainability dimension  
- To avoid legal or conceptual overlap with protected frameworks

{: .warning }
The Green Agile Guide is not an official extension of Scrum or any other framework.  
It is an independent interpretation of agile principles in the context of sustainable product development.
