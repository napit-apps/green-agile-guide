# Sustainability & Empiricism

## Empiricism in agile product development

Empiricism is a core principle of agile methods.  
It relies on **transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation** to deal with uncertainty and make informed decisions.

Instead of defining every outcome up front, teams learn continuously through small, validated steps.  
This allows them to adjust course based on evidence — not assumptions.

## Sustainability as a learning process

Sustainability is often seen as a strategic or long-term topic.  
But sustainable product development also depends on short feedback loops, data-driven decisions, and the ability to adapt over time.

Ecological impact, energy consumption, or team well-being can’t be fully predicted.  
They must be observed, measured, and improved — just like functionality or performance.

## Shared principles

Agile and sustainable thinking share the same core principles:

- **Transparency** – Make sustainability-relevant aspects of product development visible  
- **Inspection** – Observe environmental, social, and economic impact continuously  
- **Adaptation** – Change direction based on what you learn, not just what was planned

Sustainability is not in conflict with agility.  
It is a natural extension of the empirical mindset.

## Implication for teams

Agile teams already inspect and adapt features, priorities, and processes.  
With minimal effort, they can also inspect and adapt sustainability impact — if it is made transparent.

This guide provides practical ways to include sustainability in your existing feedback loops, without adding new processes or ceremonies.

{: .note }
Sustainability does not require new artifacts or methods.  
It requires awareness, visibility, and the willingness to act on what you learn.
