# Product Lead

**Strategic alignment for sustainable product value**

The Product Lead is accountable for **what is built — and why**.  
In Green Agile, this includes ensuring that **product direction aligns with sustainability goals** across all three dimensions:

- **Ecological** – conscious decisions to reduce emissions, waste, and energy use  
- **Economic** – focus on longevity, maintainability, and reduced cost of ownership  
- **Social** – creating inclusive, accessible, and meaningful products for people

This is not a new role. It is a sharper articulation of the Product Owner’s **strategic accountability** — now expanded with **awareness and responsibility for long-term impact**.

## Making sustainability actionable

The Product Lead turns sustainability from intention into **daily decisions**.  
This happens through **backlog refinement, prioritization, stakeholder alignment**, and trade-off decisions that reflect both **speed and sustainability**.

### Within the team

- **Anchor sustainability in the product backlog**  
  Include goals like carbon reduction, accessibility, and lifecycle efficiency directly in features and acceptance criteria  
  Example: Define “minimum lifetime” or “low energy mode” as acceptance conditions

- **Prioritize sustainable options**  
  Promote lean, maintainable, and energy-efficient solutions over wasteful features or architectural overreach  
  Example: Avoid premature scaling or tech stacks with high environmental cost

- **Balance delivery and team well-being**  
  Plan realistic delivery timelines to support both product goals and team health  
  Consider sustainability of the development process itself

---

### Within the organization

- **Align product with sustainability strategy**  
  Ensure the product vision reflects ESG targets and contributes to impact goals  
  Example: Create features that enable user behavior change (e.g. less resource use)

- **Make sustainability visible to stakeholders**  
  Position impact metrics as part of product value  
  Collaborate with CSR, compliance, and leadership to communicate outcomes

- **Enable evidence-based decisions**  
  Define measurable impact indicators  
  Example: CO₂ reduction potential, long-term TCO trends, accessibility scores

---

## Responsibilities across all dimensions

### Ecological sustainability

- Reduce product-related emissions and energy use  
- Integrate sustainability into backlog items, DoD, and reviews  
- Consider the full product lifecycle — including retirement and data minimization

### Economic sustainability

- Avoid waste through lean backlog and prioritization  
- Minimize technical debt and favor maintainable solutions  
- Balance speed with long-term maintainability and operational cost

### Social sustainability

- Promote inclusive design and accessibility from the start  
- Reflect diverse user needs and usage contexts  
- Support a healthy development pace and ethical impact

## Example metrics for Product Leads

Defining **sustainability indicators** helps align teams and stakeholders around meaningful goals:

- **Ecological**  
  - CO₂ reduction through product features or infrastructure decisions  
  - Reduction in data volume or energy intensity of usage  
  - Support for longer device or software lifecycles

- **Economic**  
  - Long-term Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)  
  - Technical debt reduction rate  
  - Percentage of maintainable vs. temporary solutions

- **Social**  
  - Accessibility compliance (e.g. WCAG level)  
  - User inclusion metrics (e.g. reach across age, language, ability)  
  - Engineering Team satisfaction over project lifetime

---

## Final note

The Product Lead connects **product direction** with **sustainability impact** — not by adding complexity, but by embedding **awareness, responsibility**, and **measurable outcomes** into product decisions.
