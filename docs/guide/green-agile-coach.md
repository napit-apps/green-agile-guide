# Green Agile Coach

## Role and purpose

The Green Agile Coach supports teams and organizations in integrating sustainability into their agile practice.  
This role focuses on enabling continuous [Awareness](/guide/values/awareness) and [Responsibility](/guide/values/responsibility) — the two core values of the Green Agile Guide — across all three sustainability dimensions:

- **Ecological** – reducing environmental impact of digital systems  
- **Economic** – fostering long-term maintainability and mindful use of resources  
- **Social** – protecting team wellbeing and promoting inclusive collaboration

The Green Agile Coach is not a new role, but a sharpened evolution of the agile coach or Scrum Master — with clear accountability for embedding sustainability into agile ways of working, both in day-to-day team practice and in strategic alignment with organizational goals.

## Measuring impact

To support transparency and continuous improvement, the Green Agile Coach may define and track selected indicators for sustainability.  
These indicators are not prescriptive — but without meaningful signals, sustainability remains invisible.  
Tracking even simple metrics helps teams inspect progress and adjust course.

Here are some examples by dimension:

- **Ecological**  
  - Number of avoidable builds or deployments reduced  
  - Awareness for energy consumption of development or runtime environments  
  - Reduced carbon footprint of cloud infrastructure (in cooperation with Ops)

- **Economic**  
  - Technical debt tracked and reduced over time  
  - Maintainability scores or architectural metrics  
  - Reduction of rework or waste in the value stream

- **Social**  
  - Team satisfaction and burnout indicators  
  - Psychological safety ratings from retrospectives  
  - Participation and inclusion metrics

## Final note

The Green Agile Coach is the enabler of applied sustainability in agile environments.  
They ensure that values like [awareness](/guide/values/awareness) and [responsibility](/guide/values/responsibility) become more than just words —  
they become part of how teams think, decide, and deliver.
