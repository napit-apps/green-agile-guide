# Sustainable Iteration Planning  
**Delivering value — without compromising the future**

Sustainable Iteration Planning ensures that short-term delivery aligns with long-term responsibility.  
It provides a structured way to define iteration goals, select work, and balance delivery against ecological, economic, and social impact — as defined by the Sustainability Anchors of this guide.

This planning approach brings sustainability into the daily rhythm of development.  
It clarifies what matters now — and how to deliver it with long-term viability, maintainability, and integrity.

Sustainable Iteration Planning increases focus — and embeds responsibility into every delivery decision.

## From Goal to Execution

Iteration planning aligns short-term execution with long-term responsibility.  
Sustainable Iteration Planning embeds sustainability as a core principle — not a late adjustment.

It adds a structured impact lens to each planning decision:

- **Ecological**: Reduces energy use, emissions, and digital waste  
- **Economic**: Ensures maintainability, scalability, and long-term efficiency  
- **Social**: Promotes accessibility, inclusion, and ethical design

A shared iteration goal provides focus — and allows sustainability to become part of the intention, not just the execution.  
This perspective strengthens the team’s ability to deliver value — responsibly and effectively.

## Planning the Iteration (*How*)  
**Sustainability as a driver of implementation decisions**

Iteration planning isn’t just about *what* gets delivered — but *how* it is built.  
The way work is implemented shapes its ecological, economic, and social footprint.  
Sustainability becomes a **quality lens** — influencing design, architecture, and collaboration.

**Typical signals across the three dimensions:**

**Ecological**
- Optimize code for energy efficiency and low CPU usage  
- Avoid redundant processing or excessive API calls  
- Minimize data transfer and storage requirements

**Economic**
- Design for maintainability and low long-term cost  
- Reduce complexity to avoid future rework  
- Build resilient solutions that scale without major refactoring

**Social**
- Ensure accessibility and usability across user groups  
- Design inclusive workflows and interfaces  
- Respect ethical boundaries (e.g. data usage, attention economy)

## Aligning with Capacity

Sustainable delivery respects capacity.  
Pushing beyond limits or skipping critical quality steps leads to invisible debt — technical, ecological, or human.

Sustainable Iteration Planning promotes:

- **Feasible work scopes**, matched to available capacity  
- **Room for sustainability-driven improvements**, such as refactoring or optimization  
- **Time for reflection**, learning, and continuous improvement

This creates a healthy, forward-looking delivery rhythm.

## From Iteration to Organization

Iteration-level sustainability connects daily work with broader organizational goals.  
Regulatory, ethical, or climate-related targets only have impact when they influence **real decisions**.

Sustainable Iteration Planning turns strategic intent into operational practice.

For example:

- **Corporate goal**: Reduce cloud energy usage by 10%  
- **Iteration work**: Implement caching to reduce API calls by 20%

Such alignment ensures that sustainability becomes part of the product’s *delivery logic* — not just its roadmap.

## Final Note

Sustainable Iteration Planning creates alignment between short-term delivery and long-term sustainability.  
It embeds impact thinking into scope, implementation, and the team’s delivery rhythm — enabling value delivery **without compromise**.

{: .note }
Sustainability in Green Agile is implemented **without adding new meetings**.  
Instead, it is **integrated into common Agile events**. This ensures adoption is smooth, lightweight, and compatible with frameworks like Scrum, SAFe or Kanban.
