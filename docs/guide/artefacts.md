# Artefacts & Sustainability Anchors  
**Creating transparency around value — and impact**

Artefacts provide clarity on what is being built, why it matters, and how progress is made.  
They help teams stay aligned, inspect results, and adapt based on facts — not assumptions.

In the Green Agile Guide, each artefact is extended with a **Sustainability Anchor**:  
a lightweight but powerful way to surface the **ecological**, **economic** and **social impact** of the work.  
These anchors strengthen existing artefacts without changing their original intent — and help teams turn sustainability into daily practice.

{: .note }
**Sustainability Anchors** make the long-term impact of decisions **visible, inspectable, and actionable** — directly within the artefacts that guide the work.  
They are not add-ons, but part of responsible product development.

## Artefacts in the Green Agile Guide  
The way we define work defines what we care about.  
By embedding sustainability into artefacts, teams create **transparency for impact** — and enable better decisions across time horizons.

- [Strategic Impact Planning](/guide/artefacts/strategic-impact-planning) links long-term direction with daily work — enabling sustainability to shape priorities, trade-offs, and systemic awareness.

- [Sustainable Iteration Planning](/guide/artefacts/sustainable-iteration-planning) connects short-term planning with delivery reality — balancing scope, velocity, and ecological responsibility.

- [Outcome & Quality Anchoring](/guide/artefacts/outcome-quality-anchoring) evaluates what has been delivered — using shared quality criteria and sustainability anchors to improve continuously.

Anchoring sustainability in artefacts means **seeing impact early**, not repairing it later.  
It creates clarity around value — and the cost of achieving it.

## Meetings and Events

Sustainability in Green Agile is implemented **without adding new meetings**.  
Instead, it is **integrated into common Agile events** such as
- Sprint Planning or Iteration Planning  
- Daily Scrum or Daily Check-ins  
- Sprint Review or Product Review  
- Sprint Retrospective  
- Scaled ceremonies like PI Planning or Quarterly Planning

**This ensures adoption is smooth, lightweight, and compatible with frameworks like Scrum, SAFe or Kanban.**
