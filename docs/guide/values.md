# Values & Principles

The Green Agile Guide is based on two foundational values:  
- **Awareness** – seeing the broader impact of what we build and how we build it  
- **Responsibility** – acting intentionally to reduce harm and create long-term value

These values express what sustainability means in the context of agile product development:  
Not as a goal on a roadmap — but as a lens for everyday decisions.

They serve as the ethical and strategic foundation for all roles, artifacts, and practices described in this guide.

## Why these values?

Sustainability cannot be addressed through process changes alone.  
It requires a mindset shift — a willingness to see beyond the current iteration and take ownership for long-term impact.

Awareness and responsibility close that gap.  
They connect the principles of agility with the realities of ecological boundaries, social responsibility, and economic durability.

These values give teams a practical way to make sustainability visible, discussable, and actionable — without adding complexity.

The values defined here are not an addition to existing agile value sets.  
They form the foundation of this guide and reflect its core perspective:  
**sustainable product development requires conscious decisions.**
