# Product Owner

**Strategic alignment for sustainable product value**

The Product Owner plays a key role in shaping **what is built — and why**.  
In Green Agile, this responsibility includes aligning product outcomes with the organization’s **sustainability goals** across all three dimensions:

- **Ecological** – reducing waste, emissions, and energy use through conscious product decisions  
- **Economic** – ensuring long-term maintainability and reducing total cost of ownership  
- **Social** – creating inclusive, accessible, and meaningful solutions for diverse users

This is not a new role — it’s a clearer articulation of the Product Owner’s **strategic accountability**.  
By connecting product vision, backlog, and roadmap with sustainability intent, the Product Owner ensures that ecological, economic, and social impact become **integral to value delivery**, not an afterthought.

## Making sustainability actionable
The following focus areas reflect where Product Owners can make sustainability actionable — through daily prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and product decisions that balance speed with long-term value.

### Within the team

- **Embed sustainability in the product backlog**  
  Translate strategic sustainability goals (e.g. CO₂ reduction, accessibility, longevity) into concrete backlog items  
  Include sustainability criteria in epics, features, and acceptance criteria

- **Prioritize sustainable solutions and technologies**  
  Prefer maintainable architectures and energy-efficient solutions  
  Avoid overengineering and wasteful features that increase resource consumption

- **Foster team awareness and collaboration**  
  Align product decisions with team capacity and sustainable pacing  
  Consider the social impact of the product on both users and team members

---

### Within the organization

- **Connect product and corporate sustainability goals**  
  Align the product vision with company-wide ESG strategies and sustainability targets  
  Ensure sustainability becomes a driver of product value, not a constraint

- **Communicate sustainability as business value**  
  Position sustainability as a competitive advantage in stakeholder conversations  
  Collaborate with CSR managers, compliance teams, and leadership to reflect shared goals

- **Enable measurable outcomes**  
  Define and track sustainability indicators to ensure progress is transparent  
  Create space for regular reflection and improvement in product strategy

---

## Responsibilities across all dimensions

### Ecological sustainability

- Prioritize features that reduce energy usage, data waste, and unnecessary infrastructure  
- Integrate sustainability into acceptance criteria and DoD  
- Consider the full lifecycle of digital products — from development to decommissioning

### Economic sustainability

- Avoid technical debt by favoring long-term maintainable solutions  
- Minimize TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) through resilient architecture  
- Balance short-term value delivery with long-term operational efficiency

### Social sustainability

- Ensure accessibility and inclusion are part of the product from the start  
- Promote diversity-aware design and usage patterns  
- Support healthy team dynamics through realistic planning and sustainable delivery pace

## Measuring impact

The Product Owner supports transparency by defining indicators for sustainable value creation.  
These metrics are not mandatory, but help align teams and stakeholders on meaningful outcomes.

Examples by dimension:

- **Ecological**  
  - Energy efficiency improvements in infrastructure or client code  
  - Data usage and storage optimization  
  - Reduction of carbon emissions (e.g. through cloud optimizations)

- **Economic**  
  - Total Cost of Ownership over time  
  - Technical debt reduction rate  
  - Ratio of maintainable vs. short-lived solutions in roadmap

- **Social**  
  - Product accessibility score (e.g. WCAG compliance, usability testing)  
  - Inclusion metrics for diverse user needs  
  - Long-term team and user satisfaction indicators

---

## Final note
The Product Owner turns sustainability into a **strategic product concern** — not by adding complexity, but by connecting **what** is being built with **why** it matters in the long run.
