# Roles in Green Agile

Agile roles are powerful because they provide clarity of purpose and focus.  
The Green Agile Guide builds on this foundation — not to redefine roles, but to **extend their awareness and decision space** regarding sustainability.

Each role gains a sharper understanding of how daily work influences long-term ecological, economic, and social impact.  
This enables better decisions without changing team structure or core responsibilities.

- The [Green Agile Coach](/guide/roles/green-agile-coach) supports reflection, alignment, and delivery of sustainability goals  
- The [Product Lead](/guide/roles/product-lead) ensures that product direction includes measurable, long-term value and impact  
- The [Engineering Team](/guide/roles/engineering-team) integrates sustainability into architecture, design, and technical delivery

Sustainability is a shared concern — but how it is lived depends on role-specific focus and influence.
