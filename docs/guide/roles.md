# Roles in Green Agile

Agile roles are powerful because they provide clarity of purpose and focus.  
The Green Agile Guide builds on this foundation — not to redefine roles, but to expand what they are aware of and responsible for.

Each role gains a clear view of how daily work influences long-term ecological, economic, and social impact.  
This enables better decisions without changing team structure or core responsibilities.

- The [Green Agile Coach](/guide/roles/green-agile-coach) supports reflection, guidance, and alignment on sustainability goals  
- The [Product Owner](/guide/roles/product-owner) ensures that value includes impact over time — not just delivery speed  
- The [Developer Team](/guide/roles/developer-team) brings awareness and responsibility into technical decisions and day-to-day practices

Sustainability is a shared concern — but how it is lived depends on role-specific focus and influence.
