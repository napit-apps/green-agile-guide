# Outcome & Quality Anchoring  
**Done means sustainable — not just complete**

The Definition of Done (DoD) clarifies when work is considered complete.  
In a sustainable context, it ensures that outcomes are not only functional — but viable, responsible, and resilient over time.

This anchor transforms sustainability from intent into reality.  
It provides a shared, inspectable standard that every Increment must meet — across ecological, economic, and social dimensions.

Sustainability is not an optional add-on. It becomes part of what “done” means.

## Anchoring Quality in Delivery

The DoD acts as a contract between team, stakeholders, and users.  
By embedding sustainability directly into this contract, teams commit to deliver value that holds up — technically, ethically, and environmentally.

- **Ecological**: Low energy consumption, efficient infrastructure, optimized usage  
- **Economic**: Maintainable, scalable, low in technical debt and operational cost  
- **Social**: Inclusive, accessible, and developed in a healthy, sustainable way

Each Increment is evaluated not only by *what* it achieves — but *how* it impacts the world around it.

## Embedding Sustainability in the Definition of Done

Rather than adding a separate checklist, sustainability becomes part of existing quality standards.  
Each “done” item meets one or more sustainability requirements from all three dimensions.

**Ecological**
- Code avoids unnecessary computation and redundancy  
- Network and database use are optimized to reduce load and energy  
- Performance meets thresholds for low resource consumption  
- Infrastructure choices consider energy efficiency and carbon impact

**Economic**
- Code is clean, documented, and maintainable  
- Architecture supports future scaling without costly refactoring  
- Technical debt is addressed — not deferred  
- Operational costs are minimized by smart design choices

**Social**
- Interfaces meet accessibility standards (e.g. WCAG)  
- Features are fair and inclusive across user groups  
- Development respects healthy pacing and team wellbeing  
- UX is respectful, efficient, and avoids manipulation or overload

## From Checklist to Culture

A sustainable DoD does more than validate outputs — it shapes how teams work:

- **Accountability**: All team members own sustainable delivery  
- **Clarity**: Everyone knows what “good” looks like  
- **Improvement**: Quality grows through regular inspection and learning

The DoD becomes an internal compass — guiding quality decisions in every Sprint.

## Connecting to Strategy

A sustainable Definition of Done operationalizes strategic goals — such as emissions reduction, cost efficiency, or accessibility — at the team level.

For example:

- **Goal**: Reduce cloud energy by 10%  
- **DoD**: Feature meets defined performance and infrastructure benchmarks

This ensures that sustainability doesn’t stop at intent — it becomes enforceable through shared standards.

---

## KPIs and Inspectability

A Definition of Done only adds value if it is inspectable and used consistently.  
Sustainability-focused DoDs can be measured and improved over time.

**Ecological**
- Average energy use per action or request  
- Load time and infrastructure footprint

**Economic**
- Reduced technical debt per iteration  
- Maintenance effort and refactoring frequency

**Social**
- Accessibility test scores and audits  
- Team satisfaction with sustainable working practices

## Final Note

Outcome & Quality Anchoring transforms sustainability into a living part of product quality.  
By expanding the Definition of Done, teams deliver outcomes that last — for the product, the organization, and the planet.

Sustainability in Green Agile is implemented **without adding new meetings**.  
Instead, it is **integrated into common Agile events**. This ensures adoption is smooth, lightweight, and compatible with frameworks like Scrum, SAFe or Kanban.
