# Awareness

Awareness means seeing the broader impact of what we build — and how we build it.  
It shifts attention from local goals (speed, features, cost) to system-level effects: resource use, user impact, team health, and long-term consequences.

In agile teams, awareness starts with **making invisible effects visible**.  
For example:

- How much energy does our feature consume?
- What technical debt are we creating — and for whom?
- Are we optimizing for short-term success at long-term cost?

Awareness doesn’t require full knowledge or control.  
It begins with asking better questions — and caring about the answers.

Awareness is the foundation for change.  
Teams cannot act on what they do not see, track, or acknowledge.
