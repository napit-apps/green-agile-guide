# Developer Team  
**Turning sustainability into code, architecture, and collaboration**

The Developer Team is accountable for building working software every iteration.  
In Green Agile, this accountability includes not only **what** is delivered — but **how** it is built, operated, and maintained over time.

Developers make sustainability real: through conscious design decisions, energy-aware code, and healthy team practices.  
They influence the long-term ecological, economic, and social impact of the product more directly than any other role.

The team works self-organized and shares collective responsibility for embedding sustainability into every technical and collaborative decision.

## Key responsibilities across all dimensions

### Ecological sustainability  
- Build energy-efficient and performant code  
- Avoid unnecessary builds, deployments, and compute usage  
- Optimize data usage and infrastructure to reduce digital waste

### Economic sustainability  
- Minimize technical debt and ensure maintainable, testable, scalable code  
- Use automation, CI/CD, and lean tooling to avoid waste  
- Balance speed and quality to create long-term value

### Social sustainability  
- Work at a sustainable pace and avoid burnout  
- Foster a psychologically safe and inclusive team environment  
- Share knowledge to reduce silos and support team resilience

Sustainability is not an extra layer of work — it is part of building software that lasts.

## Making sustainability measurable

Sustainability requires transparency. Developers play a key role in making it **measurable** — enabling inspection, adaptation, and long-term learning.

They define what can be tracked: through instrumentation, logging, architecture choices, and observability.  
Measurement starts in the code — not in reporting.

### Typical actions:

- **Instrument code and infrastructure**  
  Track energy usage, data transfer, compute time, or resource consumption

- **Support sustainability indicators**  
  Enable KPIs like runtime emissions, build efficiency, or carbon intensity over time

- **Log sustainable defaults and improvements**  
  Make it visible when APIs, libraries, or workflows are optimized

- **Align with product KPIs**  
  Connect technical implementation with sustainability metrics defined by the Product Owner

## Healthy collaboration & team behavior

Developers also shape the social sustainability of software development — not just the product itself.

They lead by example through respectful communication, realistic planning, and daily collaboration patterns that support long-term team health.

### Key behaviors:

- Proactively share knowledge (e.g. pairing, code reviews, internal talks)  
- Collaborate across disciplines to align goals and reduce waste  
- Design for accessibility and inclusion by default

## Example metrics by dimension

These indicators are not mandatory — but they help teams reflect, track progress, and make improvements visible.

- **Ecological**  
  - Energy usage or server load per feature  
  - Reduction in unnecessary API calls, data volume, or builds  
  - Efficiency gains in performance or infrastructure usage

- **Economic**  
  - Technical debt reduction  
  - Maintainability score or time-to-fix over releases  
  - Rework ratio or automation coverage

- **Social**  
  - Psychological safety score (e.g. team surveys or retro signals)  
  - Onboarding effectiveness and pairing rate  
  - Accessibility score of delivered product features

## Final note
Without developers, sustainability stays theoretical.  
With them, it becomes a **daily practice** — visible in every line of code, every architectural choice, and every team interaction.
