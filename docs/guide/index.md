# The Green Agile Guide  
**Agility meets sustainability — with focus and integrity**

The Green Agile Guide extends proven agile practices with clear rules, responsibilities, and artifacts for sustainable software development.  
It integrates ecological, economic, and social impact into **day-to-day decisions** — without adding new roles or ceremonies.

The guide is designed for agile software teams and organizations who want to deliver responsibly — and align product development with long-term goals.

Sustainability is not a parallel track.  
It shapes how we **prioritize**, **plan**, and **assess quality**.

To support this, the guide introduces three lightweight, integrable artefacts — directly embedded into existing workflows:

- The [**Green Product Backlog**](/guide/artefacts/green-product-backlog) helps teams order work by value **and** impact.  
- [**Sustainable Iteration Planning**](/guide/artefacts/sustainable-iteration-planning) brings sustainability into **short-term delivery planning**.  
- The [**Green Definition of Done**](/guide/artefacts/green-definition-of-done) anchors **sustainable quality** in every increment.

These artefacts are supported by a [shared anchoring model](/guide/artefacts/strategic-impact-planning) that links product decisions to corporate sustainability goals — and ensures long-term consistency across teams.

{: .note }
Sustainability in Green Agile is implemented **without adding new meetings**.  
It is integrated into familiar events such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, and Retrospective — or their equivalents in scaled setups like SAFe or Kanban.

The Green Agile Guide evolves through **empirical learning** — just like the products it helps build.  
It is not a framework replacement, but a focused **extension** for organizations that want to deliver software with long-term impact.

{: .important }
This guide has no affiliation with the official Scrum Guides, their authors, or Scrum.org.  
It builds on established agile concepts but was developed independently and extended with sustainability principles.
