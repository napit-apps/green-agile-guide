# Introduction & Motivation

## Purpose of the guide

Agile frameworks have helped teams improve delivery speed and adaptability.  
But they rarely address the long-term ecological, economic, and social impact of the systems we build.

The Green Agile Guide introduces a structured extension to agile practices.  
It supports teams in making sustainability a visible, shared, and actionable concern — without increasing process complexity.

## Who it's for

This guide is intended for agile organizations, teams, Product Leads, coaches, and decision-makers  
who want to improve how software is built — not only how fast.

It reflects real-world constraints and aims to support small, meaningful changes that scale over time.  
The content is based on applied practice and can be integrated into existing workflows.

## What to expect

The guide builds on the three established dimensions of sustainability: 
- **Ecological** – Reduce energy consumption, emissions, and waste in software systems  
- **Economic** – Support long-term maintainability and responsible use of resources  
- **Social** – Protect team health, promote inclusion, and ensure ethical development

It extends agile roles, artifacts, and commitments with sustainability-focused thinking, measurable principles, and concrete guidance.

It does not prescribe new ceremonies or replace existing frameworks.  
Instead, it complements them by addressing sustainability as a cross-cutting, strategic aspect of product development.

The guide is modular. Each section can be applied independently and adapted to your team’s context.

The Green Agile Guide is an independent work. It is not affiliated with Scrum.org, the Scrum Guide, or any official agile framework.  
Terminology and structure are inspired by established agile practices but have been extended and adapted to reflect sustainability concerns.  
Some terms have been renamed to clarify focus and avoid legal or conceptual overlap.
