# Strategic Impact Planning  
**Aligning product direction with long-term impact**

Strategic Impact Planning makes product direction **visible**, **intentional**, and **sustainable**.

It connects product vision, priorities, and impact awareness in a way that guides teams over time.  
This alignment clarifies direction and makes decisions accountable — not only in terms of business value, but also ecological, economic, and social impact.

## Core Structure  
**Three strategic components — extended by Sustainability Anchors**

Strategic Impact Planning is based on three core elements:

- A shared **Product Vision** — a clear view of what the product aims to achieve over time.  
- A conscious **Sustainability Intent** — describing how the product supports ecological, economic, and social goals.  
- A prioritized **Work List** — reflecting value, feasibility, and long-term responsibility.

These elements are extended through **Sustainability Anchors** — structured signals that surface ecological, economic, and social impact within each artefact.  
They act as lenses for prioritization and help teams ground decisions in long-term responsibility.

This approach doesn’t replace existing planning structures — it extends them where it matters most.

## Sustainable Decisions Across Time Horizons  
**Integrating sustainability into every layer of strategic planning**

Strategic Impact Planning ensures that product direction is shaped with full awareness of its long-term consequences.  
It introduces sustainability as a consistent decision lens — applied across all planning levels:

- **Short-term**: Deliver outcomes that are valuable and responsible, without introducing technical, ecological, or social debt.  
- **Mid-term**: Expose hidden costs and system effects early to ensure architectural, operational, and ethical resilience.  
- **Long-term**: Align product evolution with sustainability targets and systemic impact on users, systems, and the environment.

This clarity prepares teams to prioritize more effectively — with sustainability as a guiding principle.

## Practical Decision Inputs  
**Making sustainability visible within every artefact**

To support better prioritization, teams embed **Sustainability Anchors** into their planning artefacts.  
These anchors are simple, observable signals — tailored to each dimension:

- **Ecological**: energy use, emissions, data size, waste  
- **Economic**: maintainability, lifetime cost, system resilience  
- **Social**: accessibility, inclusion, ethical impact

Sustainability Anchors don’t prescribe what to do — they make the impact **inspectable and actionable**.  
They ensure that sustainability is part of the planning conversation — from the very beginning.

## Final Note  
Strategic Impact Planning aligns product goals with long-term responsibility.  
It sharpens direction, exposes blind spots, and enables teams to make conscious, sustainable decisions — guided by clear values and anchored in transparency.

Sustainability in Green Agile is implemented **without adding new meetings**.  
Instead, it is **integrated into common Agile events**. This ensures adoption is smooth, lightweight, and compatible with frameworks like Scrum, SAFe or Kanban.
