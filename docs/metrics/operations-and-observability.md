# Operations & Observability

This section provides an overview of all **Operations & Observability** metrics. These metrics focus on runtime behavior, operational efficiency, and infrastructure utilization in production environments. They make visible how software behaves under real workloads and how operational decisions influence energy consumption, performance stability, and system efficiency over time.

## Metrics Overview

- **[Compute Time per Deployment](/metrics-and-impact/operations-and-observability/compute-per-deploy)**  
  Measures the total compute time consumed during a deployment, highlighting delivery efficiency and operational overhead.

- **[CPU Time per Transaction](/metrics-and-impact/operations-and-observability/cpu-time-per-transaction)**  
  Measures the average CPU time required to process a single transaction, making runtime efficiency and hotspots visible.

- **[Cache Hit Rate](/metrics-and-impact/operations-and-observability/cache-hit-rate)**  
  Measures the percentage of requests served from cache, indicating how effectively caching reduces compute load and latency.

- **[Energy Consumption per Release](/metrics-and-impact/operations-and-observability/energy-per-release)**  
  Measures the estimated energy consumed by new or changed workloads introduced in a release, supporting energy-aware operations.
