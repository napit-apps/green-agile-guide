# Architecture & Infrastructure

This section provides an overview of all **Architecture & Infrastructure** metrics. These metrics help assess architectural decision quality, infrastructure sustainability, and the environmental efficiency of the regions in which workloads operate. They support teams in making transparent, well‑reasoned choices and ensure that sustainability considerations are embedded directly into system design and hosting strategy.

Below is the list of all metrics in this category:

## Metrics Overview

- **[ADR-Light Coverage](/metrics-and-impact/architecture-and-infrastructure/adr-light-coverage)**  
  Measures the percentage of significant architecture and data decisions documented with ADR-Light, improving traceability and decision transparency.

- **[Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) per Region](/metrics-and-impact/architecture-and-infrastructure/pue-per-region)**  
  Tracks the data center energy efficiency of the hosting region, supporting sustainable workload placement.

- **[Grid Carbon Intensity](/metrics-and-impact/architecture-and-infrastructure/grid-carbon-intensity)**  
  Indicates the carbon intensity of electricity in the selected region, helping teams understand and optimize the environmental footprint of hosting choices.

More Architecture & Infrastructure metrics will be added over time as the guide expands.
