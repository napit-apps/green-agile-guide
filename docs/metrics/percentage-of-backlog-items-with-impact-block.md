# **Percentage of Backlog Items with Impact Block**
Percentage of backlog items that include a fully completed Impact Block (**effect type**, **dimensions**, **metric baseline & target**, and **verification method**).  
*(Kommentar: Dieser Teil kommt von mir "metric baseline & target, and verification method". Das macht für mich nur sinn, das direkt mit festzuhalten)*

## **Summary**
This metric shows the **percentage of backlog items** that contain a fully completed Impact Block. By making the intended **ecological, economic, and social effects** of each item explicit, it strengthens **transparency** and supports **value-based prioritization** throughout the Green Agile workflow. A high coverage ensures that both **direct and indirect sustainability impacts** are identified early, enabling more informed decisions during planning, refinement, and delivery.

## **Classification**
- **Scope:** Green Product Backlog  
- **Category:** Transparency & Prioritization  
- **Effect Type:** direct / indirect  
- **Dimension(s):** ecological / economic / social
- **Measurement Frequency:** per iteration  
- **Responsible Role:**  
  - **GPO:** **mandatory completion**  
  - **GDT:** **maintenance & quality check**  

## **Purpose**
This metric ensures that every backlog item clearly states its **intended sustainable effect**, making the impact of upcoming work visible and discussable. By requiring **measurable targets** rather than assumptions, it enables teams to prioritize based on real, evidence-supported value. The resulting transparency creates a **consistent and comparable basis** for planning, refinement, and trade-off decisions. In doing so, the metric embeds **sustainability thinking** directly into the product development flow and strengthens **impact-oriented decision-making** across the team.

## **Description**
This metric captures the percentage of backlog items that contain a fully completed Impact Block. **Each Impact Block specifies:**
- **the effect type** (direct or indirect)  
- **the sustainability dimensions** involved (ecological, economic, and/or social)  
- **the selected metric**, including its **baseline and target**  
- **the verification method** that will be used to measure and validate the outcome  

A high coverage rate indicates that sustainability considerations are systematically incorporated into **backlog refinement** and **product decision-making**. As a guideline, teams should aim for at least **90% Impact Block coverage** to ensure meaningful transparency and consistency across items.

## **Calculation**
**Formula:**  
\[
\frac{\text{Items with Impact Block}}{\text{All items in scope}} \times 100
\]

The metric is calculated by dividing the number of backlog items that contain a fully completed Impact Block by the total number of items considered in the current iteration or scope. The result is then multiplied by **100** to express the value as a percentage. A higher percentage reflects stronger integration of **sustainability criteria** into backlog refinement and planning.
