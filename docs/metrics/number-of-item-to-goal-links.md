This metric represents the count of backlog items that include a direct reference to a **Green Product Goal**. By ensuring that each item is connected to a strategic sustainability objective, the metric improves traceability and alignment. It enables teams to see how iterative work contributes to broader sustainability intentions, supporting more deliberate planning and prioritization.

## Purpose
The purpose of this metric is to ensure that backlog items are not treated as isolated tasks but are clearly tied to overarching sustainability goals. This strengthens **strategic coherence**, helps product teams remain focused on impactful directions, and enables more effective discussions during planning and refinement. Clear Item‑to‑Goal links also make it easier to understand how incremental improvements contribute to **long‑term sustainable product outcomes**.

## Description
This metric captures the number of backlog items that include an explicit reference to at least one **Green Product Goal**. Such a link demonstrates that the item meaningfully contributes to a defined sustainability ambition, such as reducing environmental impact, improving user behavior, enhancing long‑term efficiency, or aligning with organizational sustainability strategies. A growing number of linked items indicates stronger integration of sustainability into daily work. Unlike percentage-based metrics, this metric is designed as a **trend metric**, where an upward trajectory reflects improved strategic alignment.

## Calculation
 
$$
\text{Number of backlog items that reference a Green Product Goal}
$$

This metric is a straightforward count. During each iteration, the team tallies how many backlog items include at least one reference to a Green Product Goal. An increase over time signals that sustainability goals are being actively incorporated into the backlog and that more items are aligned with the long‑term sustainability direction. Because products evolve, this metric should be interpreted as a **trend indicator**, with “increasing” as the desired direction rather than a fixed target value.
