# Code, Build & CI/CD

This section provides an overview of all **Code, Build & CI/CD** metrics. These metrics help assess pipeline efficiency, unnecessary compute consumption, test execution behavior, technical debt trends, and hotspots that reduce system maintainability. They support teams in improving development flow, reducing waste, and embedding sustainability into daily engineering practices.

Below is the list of all metrics in this category:

## Metrics Overview

- **[Build Minutes per Change](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/build-minutes-per-change)**  
  Measures total build time per code change, highlighting pipeline efficiency and unnecessary compute usage.

- **[Test Runs per Change](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/test-runs-per-change)**  
  Tracks how many test executions occur per change to identify over-testing and reduce redundant pipeline load.

- **[Technical Debt Trend](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/technical-debt-trend)**  
  Shows how technical debt evolves over time, helping teams understand long-term maintenance and sustainability risks.

- **[CI/CD Resources per Change](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/cicd-resources-per-change)**  
  Measures the compute time and, where applicable, cost consumed by CI/CD pipelines per change, making delivery overhead and efficiency visible.

- **[Hotspot Trend](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/hotspot-trend)**  
  Tracks the development of efficiency and sustainability hotspots over time, showing whether problem areas are being reduced or accumulating.

- **[Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Score](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/sci)**  
  Measures the carbon emissions of software per functional unit, enabling comparison of carbon efficiency across components, releases, and architectures.

- **[Energy / Compute per Transaction or Job](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/energy-per-transaction-or-job)**  
  Measures the energy or compute effort required per business transaction or batch job, providing a direct indicator of resource efficiency.
