# Code, Build & CI/CD

This section provides an overview of all **Code, Build & CI/CD** metrics. These metrics help assess pipeline efficiency, unnecessary compute consumption, test execution behavior, technical debt trends, and hotspots that reduce system maintainability. They support teams in improving development flow, reducing waste, and embedding sustainability into daily engineering practices.

Below is the list of all metrics in this category:

## Metrics Overview

- **[Build Minutes per Change](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/build-minutes-per-change)**  
  Measures total build time per code change, highlighting pipeline efficiency and unnecessary compute usage.

- **[Test Runs per Change](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/test-runs-per-change)**  
  Tracks how many test executions occur per change to identify over-testing and reduce redundant pipeline load.

- **[Technical Debt Trend](/metrics-and-impact/code-build-and-cicd/technical-debt-trend)**  
  Shows how technical debt evolves over time, helping teams understand long-term maintenance and sustainability risks.
