# Green Product Backlog Metrics

This section provides an overview of all **Green Product Backlog** metrics. These metrics help assess transparency, strategic alignment, and the sustainable impact of backlog items. They support teams in making value-based, impact-oriented decisions and ensure that sustainability considerations are embedded directly into product planning and refinement.

Below is the list of all metrics in this category:

## Metrics Overview

- **[Percentage of Backlog Items with Impact Block](impact-block-coverage.md)**  
  Measures how many backlog items include a fully completed Impact Block, ensuring transparency and value-based prioritization.

- **[Percentage of Indirect Impact Items](indirect-impact-percentage.md)**  
  Tracks how many items enable indirect sustainability effects, such as supporting sustainable user behavior.

- **[Number of Item-to-Goal Links](item-to-goal-links.md)**  
  Counts how many backlog items explicitly reference a Green Product Goal, improving strategic alignment.

More Green Product Backlog metrics will be added over time as the guide expands.
