# Data & AI

This section provides an overview of all **Data & AI** metrics. These metrics focus on data volume, data retention, compute intensity of data and machine-learning workloads, and the resulting energy use and emissions. They help teams understand and control the sustainability impact of data storage, processing, and AI-driven systems across their lifecycle.

Below is the list of all metrics in this category:

## Metrics Overview

- **[Data Volume (GB)](/metrics-and-impact/data-and-ai/data-volume)**  
  Measures the total amount of data stored for a product or system, highlighting storage footprint and growth trends.

- **[Retention Days (Weighted)](/metrics-and-impact/data-and-ai/retention-days)**  
  Captures the effective data retention duration across data domains, supporting data minimization and compliance-aware storage decisions.

- **[Compute Hours per Job](/metrics-and-impact/data-and-ai/compute-hours-per-job)**  
  Measures the compute time consumed by batch or machine-learning jobs, making heavy data-processing workloads visible.

- **[CO₂e Emissions per Job](/metrics-and-impact/data-and-ai/co2e-per-job)**  
  Measures greenhouse gas emissions per batch or ML job, combining energy consumption with regional carbon intensity.
