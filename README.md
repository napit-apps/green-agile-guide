## 🧭 About this Project

The **Green Agile Guide** is an open initiative started by [Marcel Russ](https://mehrwert.tech), an experienced Agile Coach and sustainability advocate.  
It provides a lightweight extension to agile practices that systematically includes **ecological, economic, and social impact** — **without introducing new meetings or roles**.

The guide is:
- **Framework-agnostic** (works with Scrum, SAFe, Kanban)
- **Empirically grounded** (Transparency → Inspect → Adapt)
- **Focused on measurable impact** (via sustainability metrics and quality anchors)
- **Freely available** at [greenagile.org](https://greenagile.org)

## 🚀 Motivation

While sustainability is becoming a strategic priority in many organizations, it's often disconnected from daily product development.

This guide bridges that gap by embedding sustainability into existing agile practices — using the same mechanisms teams already rely on for quality, delivery, and continuous improvement.

We believe:
- **Sustainability is not an add-on** — it must become part of how we define value and quality.
- Agile teams can drive impact **if given simple tools and shared language**.
- **Measuring what matters** helps teams make informed trade-offs.
